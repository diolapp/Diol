Diol is a free and open source dialer for Android based on the Android Open Source dialer with plans
to integrate as many features as possible from the Google Phone app. Coming soon to Google Play and
F-Droid.

## Free and open source you say?
Yup, and that's free as in beer and free as in speech. There are no strings, no fees, no ads, and
there never will be. We are licensed under the GNU GPL Version 3, which means if we release a binary,
in any form, then the source is already up or on it's way up. This also means that if you don't
like using a store app, or you don't have access to one, you can just download the source and
build it yourself.

## How can I help?
Well, for one, use the app. There are bound to be bugs and we hope that people will report them to
us, so we can work to fix them. If you have a great idea for a feature that you just really want to
and know how to implement, then just open an issue, or jump on over to the
[dev chat](https://gitter.im/diolapp) and suggest it. If we like it and the community likes it,
we'll create a new milestone for it on Github. For more information about contributing, please

## Artwork
The logo we use was created using rommanurik's
[Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html), and it was
designed to *resemble* the Google Phone logo, but not be identical for copyright reasons.
